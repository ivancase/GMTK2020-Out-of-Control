Upload of the code for my submission to the 2020 GMTK Game Jam: I'm Sorry Sir, But We're Out of Control.

Up until now I hadn't done a game jam since I was 16 years old, and I've been itching to try again with the skills I've built over the last
few years. The 48-hour GMTK Game Jam proved a perfect opportunity, and this game was incredibly fun to make! The theme was "Out of Control".

I apologize for the absolute mess of this project's organization, I had to restart half way through and paid no heed to pesky file hierarchies.
